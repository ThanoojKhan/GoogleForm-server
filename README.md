Custom Form Application - Server Side
This is the server-side component of the custom form application developed using Node.js, MongoDB, and Typescript. The server handles API requests, database operations, and business logic related to form creation and submission.

Getting Started
To get started with the server-side of the application, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the server directory:

cd custom-form-application/server
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Configuration
Before running the server, make sure to configure the MongoDB connection. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root of the server directory and providing the MongoDB connection URI:

makefile
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
Running the Server
To run the server, use the following command:


npm start
This will start the server and listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

Database
The server uses MongoDB as its database. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine, or provide a remote MongoDB URI in the .env file.
